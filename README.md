# Boston-House-Price-Prediction

This is a project for building a predictive model or system for boston houses' price prediction.
The algorithm used for this is XGBRegressor as the size of dataset is comparatively small. The dataset is taken from sci-kit learn python library. The name of the dataset is load_boston().

Since it is a regression based model. The accuracy score or the accuracy of the model was needed to be judged using r-squared error and mean absolute error.  Both these errors were very small (under 2) for both training and testing data giving the best results and a great accuracy.
